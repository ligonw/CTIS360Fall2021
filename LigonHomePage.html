<p><strong> Our Story</strong></p> 
<p>For the past six years, I have pursued a permaculture lifestyle, raising chickens, rabbits and goats and growing vegetables from seed. “I knew there was a better way, and I think I found it!”. </p>
          
<p>The journey started on November 9, 2015 when I closed on a house with land. I had finally found my way back to a connectedness to nature that truly feeds the soul! I have cleared the land, built sheds, set posts, and strung roll-wire fencing weighing more than I do. If I’m being completely candid, I purchased two baby goats and a guardian puppy before I closed on the house. Overzealous? Yes, we’ll call it that. It’s been a marathon of late nights by halogen light, sore muscles, bruises, cuts and wind/sun burn. A time of re-learning the sacred mantra “measure twice and cut once.” The reward for that blood, sweat and literal tears was realized on December 20 when I loaded two baby goats and a squirmy, white puppy with gray ears and soulful eyes into the back of a Durango. Also stuffed in was two tragic garbage bags of hay that the breeder was gracious enough to give me, out of what only can be describe as pity. Guess who didn’t know any local connections to get hay that late in the season anymore – this girl!</p>

<p><strong> What is permaculture ?</strong> Permaculture is an approach to land management that adopts arrangements observed in flourishing natural ecosystems. It includes a set of design principles derived using whole systems thinking. <strong>"Permaculture",</strong> a contraction of “permanent agriculture” or “permanent culture” is about designing ecological landscapes that produce food. The goal is harmonious connection of land, humans, microclimates, plants, animals, soils, and water in creating a regenerative productive food production system. This synergy is maximized by mimicking patterns found in nature. “The focus is not on the elements themselves, but rather on the relationships created among them, by the way we place (utilize) these elements in the landscape.” </p>

<p>The six years have been full of hard work and relearning. Honestly, I quickly realized there was so much I’d forgotten about farm life. The more I learned about permaculture, the more I wanted to prove this unconventional, holistic approach and share the experience with others. Permaculture has expanded my original ideals, to include economic and social structures that support the evolution and development of communities integrated with permaculture design concepts to-scale and applicable to any lifestyle. My goal – to be a living “proof of concept” that anyone (single household, limited budget, working full-time and going to school) can find success using the permaculture methods and using the natural environment to work for them. My success in being a trendsetter is growing. I’ve influenced several local longtime “traditional” backyard farmers, watching them go from skeptics to believers in one season. The rewards of my journey toward living this concept and sharing this knowledge with others have been immeasurable so far, and I’ve just begun”. “I can’t wait to see what the future holds for my flourishing little farm.</p>

<p><strong> What drew me to the permaculture concept?</strong></p>
<p>My inquisitive and analytical nature led me to the permaculture principles. No matter the topic, when considering new information or unfamiliar ventures, I fact-find and do research until I’m satisfied! When I decided to invest in fruit and vegetable cultivation on the farm; being on a tight budget with limited time and resources, I needed to determine the cost / benefit ratio to justify the investment. On my quest for learning the “best” and most “efficient” tools / methods for success, my research kept circling back to this concept of permaculture design. I knew there was a better way, and I think I found it! – Permaculture, a contraction of “permanent agriculture” or “permanent culture”, is about designing ecological landscapes that produce food; (“integrated farming” and “ecological engineering” are also terms used to describe Permaculture). It is a land use and community building concept which strives for the harmonious integration of humans, microclimates, annual and perennial plants, animals, soils, and water, to create stable / regenerative productive food production systems. The focus is not on the elements themselves, but rather on the relationships created among them, by the way we place (utilize) these elements in the landscape. This synergy is maximized by mimicking patterns found in nature. Emphasis is placed on the integration of multi-use plants and animals (to attract or repel predation, provide or recycle nutrients, or graze / manage invasive species of weeds for example), and cultural / human practices, resources, and inputs (such as sheet mulching, wastewater upcycling, or trellising), to create holistic zero waste, minimal input, self-sustaining food production systems. Applicable to-scale in urban as well as rural settings, single households or farms; appropriate for all individuals with any level of experience, and at any lifecycle.</p>
          
<p><strong>What has been rewarding about living this concept?</strong></p> 
<p>Permaculture entails much more than just food production, energy and resource efficiency, recycling, wastewater upcycling, and land stewardship. Permaculture has expanded my original ideals, to include economic and social structures that support the evolution and development of communities integrated with permaculture design concepts to-scale and applicable to any lifecycle. While certainly not a new concept (coined in the 70s by David Holmgren & Bill Mollison), Permaculture has recently become a growing movement (domestically and internationally). The more I learn, the more I feel the need to prove this “newfound” unconventional holistic approach and share in the experience with others. As my knowledge base has expanded, I’ve become increasingly committed to presenting permaculture ideas through practical projects and a need to teach by personal example, to prove that a sustainable lifestyle is a realistic, attractive and a powerful alternative to dependent consumerism. I’m endeavoring to be micro trendsetter to further this movement by way of proof of concept, that anyone (single household, limited budget, working fulltime and going to school) can find success using the permaculture methods and utilizing our natural environment to do the work for us. I hope to encourage folks (by example) to adopt the concepts in their own lives—because it just makes sense! It has been very rewarding to have an impact on a few local (traditional) longtime backyard farmers; and watch them go from harsh critics and sceptics to believers in just one season. By something as simple as planting an easy grow herb or row of flowers… and watching their minds blow when that plant problem they thought they had for years—magically just disappears. Then challenging them to go further in their thinking, to move away from long held backyard square plot gardening... into a holistic concept of a backyard ecological system. The rewards of my journey toward living this concept and sharing this knowledge with others have been immeasurable so far, and I’ve just begun. I can’t wait to see what the future holds for my flourishing little farm. I enjoy getting to share this passion with others.</p>
